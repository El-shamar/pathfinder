Setup:

- Unzip the compressed folder
- rename the python file from "pathfinder.py.txt" to "pathfinder.py"
- rename the python file from "tree.py.txt" to "tree.py"

!!!There's really nothing to setup


Run

Option 1 (names without any whitespace)
python pathfinder.py text.txt FirstName SecondName

Option 2: (names with whitespace should be placed within quotation marks):
python pathfinder.py text.txt "First Name" "Second Name"

Test:

The program was tested and performed as expected on the following platforms:
	1)ubuntu 14.04 LTS

	2) Microsoft's Windows 7 Ultimate
